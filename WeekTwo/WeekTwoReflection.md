# Week Two Summary -- MGS Web3 Cohort

## Key Focus Areas

- MEV (Maximal Extractable Value)
- Web3 security fundamentals
- Staying safe in decentralized ecosystems
- Understanding background mechanics of blockchain technology
- Establishing trust and resilience in Web3

## What We Covered

### 1. MEV and Its Importance

We explored how validators and searchers extract value from block
production, why MEV exists, and how it affects network participants.
Discussions included: - Types of MEV\

- Sandwich attacks\
- Arbitrage\
- How protocols are working to reduce harmful MEV

### 2. Security in Web3

A major theme was user safety: - Common attack vectors (phishing, fake
airdrops, scam contracts)\

- Wallet hygiene and operational security\
- Transaction simulation tools\
- Importance of verifying contracts and sources

### 3. Staying Safe in Web3

We looked at: - Best practices for hot wallets\

- How to segregate risk using multiple wallets\
- How not to get rugged\
- The role of knowledge in avoiding avoidable losses

### 4. Blockchain Mechanics

We received a foundational initiation into: - How blocks are produced\

- What validators actually do\
- The lifecycle of a transaction\
- Why decentralization enhances trust

## Reflections

Week Two was an initiation into the *hidden machinery* of blockchain.\
By understanding MEV, security, and blockchain mechanics, we gained: -
Greater awareness\

- Reduced risk\
- Increased confidence\
- A stronger sense of trust in the Web3 ecosystem

This week built the technical and psychological foundation for
navigating Web3 responsibly.
