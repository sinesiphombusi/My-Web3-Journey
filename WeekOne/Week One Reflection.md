This first week has been both exciting and humbling. Diving into Web3 felt like stepping into a whole new digital universe — one that’s built on ownership, decentralization, and collaboration.

We started by tracing the internet’s evolution from Web1 (read) to Web2 (read and write) and now Web3 (read, write, own). That simple breakdown helped me understand how far we’ve come and how much potential still lies ahead.

Learning about blockchains, smart contracts, and decentralized networks was eye-opening. These concepts can feel abstract at first, but once you start connecting them to real-world use cases, things start to click.

A big part of this week was also getting comfortable with Git and GitHub — tools that are crucial for collaboration in Web3 spaces. I had to navigate some challenges, especially around Markdown and version control, but passing the quiz on Web3 concepts made it worth it.

I’m learning to embrace being a beginner again. Every small win — every new command, concept, or insight — adds up.

Takeaway: You don’t have to know everything right away. Start where you are, stay curious, and keep building.

Here’s to Week Two — more learning, more growth, and more connections ahead 🚀
